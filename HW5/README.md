# HW5: Natural Language Processing
## Problem Description: Sentiment Analysis for IMDB Movie Reviews
This assignment will work with the Large Movie Review Dataset and provide an understanding of how Deep Learning is used within the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP). The original paper published in 2011 discussing the dataset and a wide variety of techniques can be found here. We will train models to detect the sentiment of written text. More specifically, we will try to feed a movie review into a model and have it predict whether it is a positive or negative movie review.

The assignment starts off with how to preprocess the dataset into a more appropriate format followed by three main parts. Each part will involve training different types of models and will detail what you need to do as well as what needs to be turned in. The assignment is meant to provide you with a working knowledge of how to use neural networks with sequential data.

- Part one deals with training basic Bag of Words models.
- Part two will start incoporating temporal information by using LSTM layers.
- Part three will show how to train a language model and how doing this as a first step can sometimes improve results for other tasks
- Make a new directory for yourself on BlueWaters. Do everything within this directory and this will ultimately contain most of what you need to turn in.

Iâ€™m not directly providing you with any finished python files. This is written more like a tutorial with excerpts of code scattered throughout. You will have to take these pieces of code, combine them, edit them, add to them, etc. and figure out how to run them on BlueWaters. You will also need to change a variety of hyperparameters and run them multiple times.

## What to turn in
Make a copy of the google sheet here. This is how you should summarize your results. Write a sentence or two for each model you train in parts 1a, 1b, 2a, 2b, and 3c. For part 3a, the assignment only requires you to train the model with the hyperparamters I give you. For part 3b, you will generate fake movie reviews
