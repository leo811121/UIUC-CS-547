# HW4
## Problem Description
Implement a deep residual neural network for CIFAR100. 
In order to get a full credit, you need to achieve at least the accuracy mentioned below for
each task except for ResNet CIFAR100 with asynchronous SGD. ResNet CIFAR100 with
asynchronous SGD is a 10-point bonus question.
|       File      | Accuracy |
| ----------------| ---------|
| ResNet CIFAR100 |   50%    |
| ResNet CIFAR100 |   70%    |
| ResNet TinyImageNet |   60%|
| ResNet TinyImageNet |   50%|
| Pre-trained ResNet CIFAR100|  70%|
| ResNet CIFAR100 with synchronous SGD |  60% |
